Red and Black Tree (RBT) - Insert and Delete

0. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW COMPLETELY AND CAREFULLY BEFORE PROCEEDING.

0.1 THE CLASS LECTURE ON RBT HAS MORE DETAILS ON HOW THEY WORK, ALONG WITH A LINK TO CLRS CHAPTER. READ THEM BEFORE PROCEEDING.

Introduction

1. In this assignment you will be implementing

    a) a red-black tree (RBT) using C++ classes, inheritance, and upcasting.

2. Declaration for the required classes (rbt.h) are provided. These must not be changed, and your implementation must follow them.

3. First, read the BST (declared in bst.h) implementation and use the unittest_bst() function to test it. DO NOT CHANGE THIS CODE FOR YOUR SUBMISSION.

4. Implement the RBT and use the unittest_rbt() function to test it. DO NOT CHANGE THIS CODE FOR YOUR SUBMISSION, as it will be used to test your code against the answers (with different inputs).

    a) Implementations for some functions (e.g., min, max, succ, pred, walk, search) have already been provided - READ THEM CAREFULLY and understand them.

    b) Implement the insert function (i.e., void rb_insert_node()). This will also require you to implement the rb_insert_fixup(), and right_rotate() and  left_rotate() functions as well.

  c) Implement the delete function (i.e., void rb_delete_node()). This will also require you to implement the rb_delete_fixup() function.

5. Test your code against the provided input and output files.

    a) The provided answers for the RBT unit test are in "test_t7_s1" and "test_t12_s1". The s1 refers to the seed of 1 (-s 1), and t7/t12 refers to the number of elements to add to the RBT (-t 7 or -t 12).

6. Make sure your code has no memory leaks (using valgrind).

7. Your code should work beyond the provided unit tests. That is, even if it does work for all the given tests, if the code has an identifiable bug (i.e., by reading the source code), points WILL be deducted.

8. As before, complete the homework, and then push to GitHub. If you do not push to GitHub, the TA and I cannot see the code, and it will be considered a late assignment (i.e., not graded).



9. SOME HINTS: 

  a) Insert will require first calling BST's insert function (i.e., BST::insert_node()), followed by code that accounts for the sentinel, and then calling the fixup function (i.e., rb_insert_fixup()).

  b) Delete functions requires a small change to BST's delete function (i.e., BST::delete_node()). As such, I recommend you copy & paste the code from BST, and then modify it accordingly. Re-using (i.e., first calling BST's delete_node function and adding code for RBT) is possible but messy, so I leave it up to you to decide which path to take.

  c) I recommend starting with the rotation functions, thoroughly test it, and then implement the insert function, followed by the delete function. For the insert function, first make sure the call to BST's insert is working correctly, and then add the fixup code. Similar idea applies to the delete function.
